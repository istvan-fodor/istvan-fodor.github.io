I started programming at the age 15.
Pascal was the only programming language I had heard about at that point, so I started there.
After high-school I studied Computer Science at the University of Debrecen.
After high-school I graduated with a Bachelors in 2007 and a Masters in 2010 in Computer Science at the University of Debrecen.
